# Project Binary Tree

## Overview
Welcome to the Binary Tree project! This project is a simple implementation of a binary tree data structure in C programming language. A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. This project aims to provide a basic understanding of binary trees and their operations.

## Features
Binary Tree Creation: Easily create a binary tree by specifying the root node and its children.
Insertion: Insert new nodes into the binary tree at the appropriate position.
Traversal: Perform depth-first traversal of the binary tree using various methods:
In-order traversal
Pre-order traversal
Post-order traversal
Search: Search for a specific value in the binary tree.
Deletion: Remove nodes from the binary tree while maintaining its structure.
